## Interpreter

Some sort of interpreter should be provided as part of the toolkit. This will allow for rapid prototyping and development without having to employ build systems and the like.

To this end, a (probably register-based) bytecode will be developed, and executed in a simple VM. This VM can be provided as an executable binary on various platforms, which will immediately increase the portability of software written in the language.
